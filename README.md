## Introduction

This project is a terminal-based recreation of the classic Pacman game in C++. Navigate Pacman through a maze, collect pellets, avoid ghosts, and chase them when powered up. Features include ASCII visuals, dynamic ghost AI, power-ups, score tracking, win/lose conditions, and customizable mazes, demonstrating fundamental programming skills.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Experience the traditional Pacman mechanics with a modern codebase.
- **Dynamic Ghost AI**: Ghosts exhibit behaviors such as chasing, scattering, and fleeing.
- **Power-Ups**: Collect power pellets to temporarily turn the tables on the ghosts.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you progress through the game.
- **Customizable Mazes**: Modify the maze layout to create unique challenges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- **Development Environment**: An IDE or text editor of your choice.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Markiscoding2/Pacmac-game.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Pacmac-game
   ```
3. **Compile the Game**:
   ```bash
   g++ -o pacman Pacman.cpp clase_player_fantome.cpp functii_meniu.cpp functii_movement_harta.cpp
   ```
4. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   ./pacman
   ```

## Gameplay

### Controls

- **Movement**: Use the arrow keys to navigate Pacman through the maze.

### Objectives

- **Collect Pellets**: Eat all the pellets in the maze to clear the level.
- **Avoid Ghosts**: Steer clear of ghosts to prevent losing lives.
- **Power Pellets**: Consume power pellets to temporarily make ghosts vulnerable, allowing Pacman to eat them for extra points.

## Code Structure

- **Pacman.cpp**: Contains the main game loop and core logic.
- **clase_player_fantome.cpp**: Defines the behaviors and properties of Pacman and ghost characters.
- **functii_meniu.cpp**: Manages the game menu and user interface elements.
- **functii_movement_harta.cpp**: Handles maze generation and movement mechanics.
